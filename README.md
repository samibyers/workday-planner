Work Day Scheduler

Description:

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. When the user enters notes into the time slots and clicks the save button, the data is stored in localstorage and will persist on the page even when the refresh button is clicked. The time slots also change color based on whether the current time is in the past, present, or future. The current day is displayed at the top of the page.
